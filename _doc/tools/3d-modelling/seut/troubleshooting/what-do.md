title: There is an issue - what do I do?
---

The first step should always be to gather more information on exactly what went wrong. In the case of SEUT, if there is no error popup, this means checking the `Blender System Console` which can be opened by going to `Window --> Toggle System Console`. You're searching for anything in there marked with "SEUT". If you can find an error with a code, the list below will provide some more information on each error. Warnings are generally non-breaking errors. They serve to note down the things that might be unintentional to help with solving issues.

If you cannot find an answer to your issue, or if you find something marked `Traceback` in your `Blender System Console`, your next step should be to search through the open GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/enenra/space-engineers-utilities/issues). If you cannot find an issue pertaining your particular case, feel free to open up a new issue.
