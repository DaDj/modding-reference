* **Stollie** - So much general help but also writing everything character, export and MWM-related, which I wouldn't have been able to do at all.	
* **Harag** - Writing the [original Blender SE plugin](https://github.com/harag-on-steam/se-blender). A lot of code in this addon is based on his.	
* **Wizard Lizard** - For hours of testing as well as writing the [SE Texture Converter](https://github.com/TheWizardLizard/SETextureConverter) to save us all from having to deal with batch files.
* **Kamikaze (Blender Discord)** - Writing the `remapMaterials()`-function and generally helping out constantly by answering a lot of questions.
* **CGCookie** - For the creation of the fantastic [Blender Addon Updater](https://github.com/CGCookie/blender-addon-updater) that is being used for SEUT.
