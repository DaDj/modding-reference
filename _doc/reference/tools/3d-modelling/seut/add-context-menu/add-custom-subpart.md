title: Add Custom Subpart
---
Subpart empties mark the **location of a subpart model** when the model has been added into Space Engineers. This functionality allows the creation of a custom subpart, which can for example be animated via script. Refer to the [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-map}Subpart Tutorial]() to learn how to use subparts.

### Name
Simply enter the name you would like your subpart empty to have into this field.
