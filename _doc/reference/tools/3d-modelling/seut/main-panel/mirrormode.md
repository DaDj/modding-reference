Mirroring Mode is used to set up block mirroring options within Space Engineers. Its results are written to the SBC. Refer to the [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-map}Mirroring Tutorial]() for more details.

#### Note
Mirroring Mode relies on materials to convey a lot of its information. Be sure to enable a viewport shading mode that displays materials when using it.

This links to a `Mirroring`-type scene, which is used instead of an instance of the normal model contained within the `Main`-collection for mirroring display.
