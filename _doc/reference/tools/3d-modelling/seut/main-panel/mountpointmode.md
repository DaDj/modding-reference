Mountpoint Mode allows the user to define the **areas of the block** that **attach to other blocks**. Mountpoints are divided by the block's `Sides`. Each `Side` can have multiple defined `Areas` that are valid attachment points. Refer to the [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-map}Mountpoint Tutorial]() for more details.

### Side
Select one of the six sides of the block as a target for the `Add Area`-button.

### Add Area
Adds a new area to a side that can be repositioned and rescaled (rotation is not saved).
