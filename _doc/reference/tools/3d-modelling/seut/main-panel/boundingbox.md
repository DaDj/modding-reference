title: Bounding Box

![](/modding-reference/assets/images/reference/seut/bounding-box_1.png)

The bounding box **indicates the size of the block** inside Space Engineers. Be sure to adjust it so all of your block is within it (unless in some special cases). 

<div class="callout-block callout-warning"><div class="icon-holder">*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-bug}
</div><div class="content">
{: .callout-title}
#### Warning
The entirety of the collision model must be within the bounding box - otherwise the block will revert to cube collision.
</div></div>

### Size
Use the `X`, `Y` and `Z`-properties to adjust the size of the bounding box. These values are written to the SBC.

### Automatic
This button will make the addon attempt to automatically set the bounding box to encompass the entire geometry. It is currently not very accurate.
