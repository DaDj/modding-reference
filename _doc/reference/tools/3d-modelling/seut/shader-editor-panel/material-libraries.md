### MatLib Selection
This menu allows the selection of which MatLibs from the `Materials`-folder should be linked to the current file. Linking a MatLib will link the materials it contains to the current `BLEND`-file.

### Refresh MatLibs
Clicking this button refreshes the MatLibs listed in the menu above. MatLibs are also refreshed every time the user defines a new `Materials`-folder in the addon's preferences.

### Export Materials to Library
This button will export all materials contained within the current file to an `XML`-file. The export will skip all materials that have only been linked into the current `BLEND`-file. The exported `XML` file will be placed in your `Materials`-folder.
