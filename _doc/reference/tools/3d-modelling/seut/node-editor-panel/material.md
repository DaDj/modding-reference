#### Note
If the options in this section are greyed out, that is because the currently active material is linked into the `BLEND`-file - for example from a MatLib. As such, unless the material is made local, it cannot be edited directly.

### PaintedMetal_Colorable
This line displays the name of the currently active material as well as a small preview of how it looks.

### Preset: No Alpha, No Emissive
This line displays the material preset that was used to create the material. The preset determines which texture-types the material supports and how they are displayed.

### Override MatLib
This checkbox allows you to force a custom material created in the current file to overwrite a material with the same name that is linked into this `Blend`-file. Normally, if a material with name X in a file also exists in a MatLib, the local material would be replaced by the MatLib material X. This ensures that the *local* material X is used over the one contained in a MatLib. Refer to the [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-map}Override Vanilla Material Tutorial]() for more details.
