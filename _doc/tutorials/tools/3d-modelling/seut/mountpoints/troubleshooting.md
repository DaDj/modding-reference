### Testing Mountpoints Ingame
* Alt + F-something menu, dev menu
* not always available

### Mountpoints are Completely Misaligned in Blender
* when setting them up, turning off mode and turning it back on
* when using Edit mode it isn't saved correctly, use object mode
* apply transformations

### Mountpoints are not Saved Correctly
* rotation is not saved
* mode only saves origin + dimensions
