| This tutorial teaches you how to **add "highlight functionality" to your block**, outlining a certain part of the model in yellow when you target a conveyor, terminal, screen etc. It further explains how to **edit existing highlight empties** and how to **troubleshoot any issues** that might appear.

### Goal
To get Space Engineers to correctly display a yellow highlight around a part of your model when you aim at it - like so:

[![](/modding-reference/assets/images/tutorials/seut/interaction-highlight_goal.png){:class="img-responsive-thumbnail"}](/modding-reference/assets/images/tutorials/seut/interaction-highlight_goal.png)

### Prerequisites
* A block model ready to be set up.
* The part of the model you want to have a yellow outline must be a separate mesh.
