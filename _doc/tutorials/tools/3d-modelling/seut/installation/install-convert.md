title: II. Install the Downloaded Files & Convert the Textures
---

1. Install the downloaded Havok Content Tools to `SEUT\Tools\Havok\`.

2. Run `bulkTexConverter.exe` in `SEUT\Tools\`. Point it at the correct folders for your SE installation, SEUT Tools folder and SEUT Textures folder and load presets by using `File --> Load Presets` (top left of the window). Then run the conversion. This may take several minutes to complete.

3. Open Blender, go to `Edit --> Preferences... --> Add-ons` and toggle `Enabled Add-ons only` to `ON`.

4. Click `Install...` and select the freshly downloaded `space_engineers_utilities_***.zip`. The addon should now show up in the list:
