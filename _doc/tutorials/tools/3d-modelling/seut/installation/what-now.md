title: IV. What now?
---

This concludes the installation and setup of the SEUT addon for Blender. Now is a good time to familiarize yourself with its interface and usage. To help you with that, a thorough reference for the addon's functionality as well as extensive tutorials about to use said functionalities have been created. You can find them below.

Additionally, you can join the [SEUT Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QtyCsBr) and [KeenSWH Discord](https://discord.gg/2Bp6REAVFb). While the former is the official place to get help with the addon, the latter generally has more active SEUT users checking it.

Lastly, please note that SEMREF nor the people on either discord are there to teach you the basic controls and functionality of Blender itself. There are hundreds of available tutorials online, in whatever form you prefer. A good starting point, for example, is this [Blender Fundamentals 2.8 YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6). Please make use of that as it makes it much easier for us to teach you SEUT itself. :-)
