title: "I. Download & Unpack the Necessary Files"
---
1. Download the latest release of SEUT, its supplementary files and the additional required tools from the [download](https://space-engineers-modding.github.io/modding-reference/tools/3d-modelling/seut/download.html)-section.
<br><br/>

2. Unpack the SEUT Supplementary Files into a drive with ~6GB of available disk space. (Required for the converted textures.) This should yield you the following structure in the resulting directory: 

    ```
    SEUT\Materials\
    SEUT\Textures\
    SEUT\Tools\
    ```
<br><br/>
3. Unpack the downloaded `StollieMWMBuilder.rar` into `SEUT\Tools\MWMB\`.
<br><br/>

4. Place the downloaded `FBXImporter.exe` into `SEUT\Tools\`.
