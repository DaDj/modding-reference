title: "I. Download & Unpack the Necessary Files"
---
1. Download the latest release of SEUT, its supplementary files and the additional required tools from the [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-download}download](/modding-reference/tools/3d-modelling/seut/download)-section.
<br><br/>

2. Unpack the SEUT Supplementary Files into a drive with ~6GB of available disk space. (Required for the converted textures.) This should yield you the following structure in the resulting directory: 

    ```
    SEUT\Materials\
    SEUT\Textures\
    SEUT\Tools\
    ```

3. Unpack the downloaded `StollieMWMBuilder.zip` into `SEUT\Tools\MWMB\`.
<br><br/>

4. Place the downloaded `FBXImporter.exe` into `SEUT\Tools\`.

5. Install the **Space Engineers ModSDK**, which is available on **Steam**. Find and install it by activating `Tools` in your Steam Library:
