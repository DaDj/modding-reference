title: III. Set Up the Addon in Blender
---
1. Set the paths in the preferences of `Scene: Space Engineer Utilities` to the respective folder and tools.

<br><br/>

2. In the Blender main view (`3D Viewport`), open the SEUT main panel by pressing `N`. On the right side of the viewport, a tab labelled `SEUT` will become available. This is where most of the functionality of SEUT is accessed from.

3. Go to the `Shading`-tab at the top of the Blender window. In the bottom center you will see the `Shader Editor`. Press `N` with your cursor within the `Shader Editor` to open up another toolbar will become available. Open the `SEUT`-tab and enable `MatLib_Presets` in the Material Libraries panel. If you wish to import vanilla Space Engineers models, also enable `MatLib_Materials` and `MatLib_Items`.

4. In the Blender header, click `Window --> Toggle System Console`. SEUT will print additional information in here and it is the first place you should check if something doesn't work as it seems like it should.
