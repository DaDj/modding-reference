### Highlight looks like a yellow square
If your highlight looks like a yellow square it means that something went wrong when associating your highlight empty with your highlight object. Ensure the following:
* Both the empty and target object must be parented to the same object.
* The empty and target object must conform to the naming scheme.
* All indexes on the same empty type must be unique.
