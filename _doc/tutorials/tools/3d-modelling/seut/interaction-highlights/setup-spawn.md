title: I. Setup Model & Spawn Empty
---
1. First of all, your blend file must of course contain the SEUT standard collections, specifically the `Main`-collection, and your model must be placed within it.

2. Next, you will have to ensure that all separate parts of your model are parented to a single object or empty. As you can see in the following picture, all individual parts of my example model are parented to the empty named "Model".
