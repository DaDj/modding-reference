title: II. Edit Existing Empties & Test Functionality
---
1. In order to edit the object an existing highlight empty targets, select the empty and access its `Object Data Properties`. There, you'll find a `Space Engineers Utilities`-panel, in which you can set the `Highlight Object` of the selected empty.

    <div class="callout-block callout-info"><div class="icon-holder">*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-info-circle}
    </div><div class="content">
    {: .callout-title}
#### Note
    Objects that do not have the same parent as the highlight empty are not selectable as a target object. You must first move either the empty or the target object for both to be on the same level in the hierarchy.
