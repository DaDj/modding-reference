title: I. Setup Textures
---
1. First, you of course need textures that are created with Space Engineers in mind. For this tutorial, it is assumed that you have already completed that step. 

2. The textures need to be exported to two formats: A `DDS` compression that Space Engineers can read and a format that Blender can read - for SEUT we generally use `TIF`. The latter is purely for display in Blender as it does not have the ability to read the `BC7` compression that Space Engineers requires.

3. Place the `TIF` textures either directly into your `SEUT\Textures\`-folder, or within a separate directory whose path includes `\Textures\ `. Ensure that the path below `\Textures\` is the same for the `DDS` files you place into your mod's Textures-directory.
