#### Note
    There is **no real mirroring** in Space Engineers. Mirroring is achieved by defining which ways a block should be rotated to achieve something that looks like a mirrored block on the other side of the mirror axis. But this only works for blocks that are symmetrical on at least one axis. Should that not be a case, it is necessary to define a `Mirror Model`.
