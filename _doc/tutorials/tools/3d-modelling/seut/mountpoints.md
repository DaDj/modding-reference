| This tutorial teaches you how to **set up mountpoints for blocks**. Mountpoints define, **which part of your block another block can be attached to**. For example, catwalk blocks cannot be attached to on the empty side of their block.

### Goal
To set up the mountpoints of your block in a way that makes logical sense - e.g. disallow placement of other blocks on sides where the geometry of your block does not reach the block bounding box.
